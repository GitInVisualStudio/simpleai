# simpleai
is a little project from me where I try to implement machine learning algorithms only using numpy. I alwasy try to implement them as clean as possible to make them easy to understand.

# Installation
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/GitInVisualStudio/simpleai
  cd simpleai
  pip3 install numpy
  python3 setup.py develop
```

# Run examples

```bash
  python3 examples/nnet_mnist.py
```

# Note
if you have suggestions for improvements please open an issue. I am trying my best, but I am still learning.
